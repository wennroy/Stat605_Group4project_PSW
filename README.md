# Stat605_Group4project_PSW

## Project Introduction 
The goal of this project is to develop a method to classify different bird songs based on 12GB datasets of 13 bird species. 
And our dataset contains the birdsong audios from different bird species.

Firstly We preprocess the audios data parallel on CHTC since it is the most time consuming process in our project. 

Then we use Single Hidden-Layer Neural Network with skip layer connection to classify the birds species. 

At the end, we obtained a model with an accuracy 49.14% on test datasets, 
which is larger than a random guess (7.7%) or guessing on the most frequent bird species (17.92%) among 13 bird species.
